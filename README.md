# pineapple

This is the interface for a school project i called RaspberryPineapple.

## Project overview

As you can probably guess the [raspberry](https://github.com/5N41P4/raspberry) part is in another repository with the same name. You don't need to clone this repository if you don't want to add to or customize the interface.

If you however are, fell free to clone or fork the interface. It is written entirely in Vue Version 3, and I'll just append the standard README from any Vue project here:
